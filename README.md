# ACVHoloLens

An Active Computer Vision Augmented Reality Platform. 

The goal of this project is to develop a platform that will allow for the deployment and collection of weakly annotated data in an augmented reality setting. This is a tool for obtaining video, audio, and eye-gaze data from a user wearing the Microsoft HoloLens 2. 

The project is split up into two main parts:

* An app for the Hololens 2 which is built using Unity with the help of several different APIs and toolkits.
* Server side app developed in Python which can be executed on any machine.
